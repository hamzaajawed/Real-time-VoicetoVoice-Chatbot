"VoiceFlow: Real-time Speech-to-Speech AI Chatbot"

A Voice-to-Voice Chatbot is an AI-powered conversational system that allows users to communicate entirely through spoken language. It transcribes spoken input into text, processes the text to generate a response, and converts the response back into speech. The chatbot can be used in various applications, from customer service to personal assistants, offering a hands-free and natural conversational experience.
